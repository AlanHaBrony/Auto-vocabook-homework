# Auto-vocabook-homework

Well, this semaster I inevitably has a ESS class, and a vocabulary .doc homework. However, the process is just repeating ctl C and ctl V (So annoying，and will interrupt my reading time) So I, as a noob cs bs，will try to make a program to rescure me.

In a word, this is a script to automatically clt C and clt V for specific columns from web app
(detailed progress is saved in the project)

Oh what a surprise, all the words become "word" lol
